ASSASSINATE
ASSASSINATE SHADOWLORD
1
The shadowlords have a special opening attack called assassinate. This 
power allows the shadowlord to jump from the shadows (must be hidden) and 
strike a serious and sometimes lethal attack on the target. This will also 
start the combat. 'hidden' means that you must use the hide command first.

Syntax: assassinate [target]
