DEATH
DEATH PLAYERKILLING
1
When you die, your character will be reincarnated at the center of the city
square, and your corpse is left behind in the room where you were killed,
together with all of your equipment (unless it was claimed).

Corpses decay after time, and the objects inside corpses decay with them.
Player corpses last *roughly* 30 hours of game time (15 minutes of real time).
