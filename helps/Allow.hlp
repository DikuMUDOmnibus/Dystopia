Syntax: ban

BAN [site] prohibits players from that site from logging in.  BAN with
no arguments lists the banned sites.  ALLOW [site] removes a site from
the ban list.

The site ban test works by suffix comparison, so if you ban 'foo.edu',
all sites within 'foo.edu' are banned as well.

Site bans are not saved; every time the server is rebooted, the site
ban list is cleared.
