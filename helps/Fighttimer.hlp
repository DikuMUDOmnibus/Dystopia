FIGHTTIMER
FIGHTTIMER FT COMBAT
1
On your standard prompt you will notice a section called 'ft', this is your
fighttimer. When your fighttimer is larger than zero, then no room is safe,
and certain powers will no longer work.

You gain a fighttimer each time you do battle with another player,
and it will slowly drop outside combat.
