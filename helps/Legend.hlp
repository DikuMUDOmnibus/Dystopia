LEGEND INFORMATION

After reaching almighty rank, a player can reach legendary levels by expanding
huge amounts of primal energy. The ritual required to raise ones legendary
status costs much gold, which must all be sacrificed to the great Calim.

Each point of legend status gives +25 hitroll/damroll as well as +100 damcap.
