CATALYST
CATALYST CATALYZE WARLOCK
1
Warlocks can envolope themselves in a mantle of power, which gathers
energies from attacks directed at the warlock. This mantle requires
a slight upkeep cost in mana, but when discharged, using the catalyze
command, it will boost them warlock with mana, coming from the energies
collected.

Use catalyst to turn on the mantle, and catalyze to drain mana from it.

Overloading the mantle will cause it to explode, so remember to drain it
before it is to late.
