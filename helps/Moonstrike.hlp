MOONSTRIKE SOULREAPER DIRTTHROW GUTCUTTER SHADOWLORD
1
The shadowlords have access to a series of attack types, which can be used
as midround attacks. If these attacks are used in a specific combination,
a special affect will occour. For instance, should a shadowlord first use
the caltrops attack, followed by the knifespin attack, he or she will 
summon a barrier of knives, which will add extra attacks each combat 
round. There are several of these attacks, and the more powerful the 
combo, the longer the sequence of attacks to turn it on.
