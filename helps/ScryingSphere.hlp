'SCRYING SPHERE' WARSCRY WARLOCK
1
The scrying sphere can be created by a warlock that has gained at least
three levels in the divination sphere of magic. It will create a scrying
device, which can be used to spy on players and mobiles.

This sphere can also be used together with the '@@eyespy@' power, which
allows the warlock to send his or her familiar through the spying device.
