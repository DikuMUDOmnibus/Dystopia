'MURDER OF CROWS' CROWS WARLOCK
1
The murder of crows summoning spell is used by Warlocks to steal equipment
from other players/mobiles. When fighting, the warlock can send out the
call to the murder of crows, which will arrive shortly after, and start
picking equipment from those fighting the Warlock (and delivering it to
the inventory of the Warlock).
