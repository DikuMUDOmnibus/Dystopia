SHATTER SHIELD
'SHATTER SHIELD' SHATTERSHIELD WARLOCK
1
The Warlock shattershield command will call forth a pack of glowing orbs 
that circle around the Warlock causing attacks to hit the orbs instead.
The orbs will break upon impact, and when the last orb is destroyed, the
shattershield spell fades. Due to the flickering nature of these orbs, it
is impossible to know exactly how many orbs are left.

Syntax: shattershield.
