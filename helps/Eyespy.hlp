EYESPY
EYESPY WARLOCK
1
Eyespy is a special spell used by warlocks that have mastered the sphere of
divination. It allows the warlock to pluck an eye from his or her own body,
and give it a life of it's own. This eye can either be placed in the room
where the warlock is standing, or be thrown through a scrying sphere.

Syntax: eyespy [sphere]
