CONSIDER INFORMATION
1
Syntax: consider [character]

CONSIDER tells you what your chances are of killing a character, taking 
into account hitroll, damroll, armour class and hit points, and giving 
you an overview of your chances.  If you are considering a player, you 
will also be informed how skilled they are with their weapons, and which 
stance they are currently using (if any) and how good they are at it.

Please remember that this is only a rough estimate.
