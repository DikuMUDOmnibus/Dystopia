MASTERY-SHADOWLORD
1
The shadowlord mastery item is a set of whirling blades, which will hover
around the shadowlord on combat, and can be commanded to attack whoever
the shadowlord is fighting. This will open up to a new midround attack called
whirl, and thus allow for one new combo attack (which the shadowlord must
learn on his own).
