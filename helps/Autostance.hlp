The autostance command will enable you to choose a default stance, which
you will always drop into when starting a new fight. You must be able
to normally stance into a stance before you can autostance it.

You can pick between two types of autostances, one for fighting monsters,
and another for fighting players. Use the syntax below to set the right
stance for you.
