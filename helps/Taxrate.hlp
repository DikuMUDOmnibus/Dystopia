TAXRATE KINGDOM

The taxrate is the percentage of all earned goldcrowns that goes towards
the kingdoms treasury. If a player is a member of a kingdom when he or she
earns any questpoints by questing, this percentage will be subtracted from
the earned goldcrowns, and placed in the kingdoms treasury.
