SEVEN STITCHES
'SEVEN STITCHES' STITCHES WARLOCK
1
Any warlock that has gained the '@@contingency chain@' evolve can also gain
this evolve, which grants the warlock the ability to "sew shut" the mouth
of any player. When stitched up like this, cast of normal spells becomes
impossible, as well as talking. Flexing will break these stitches.

This evolve opposes the '@@precognition@' evolve, and only one of these two
evolves can be gained.
