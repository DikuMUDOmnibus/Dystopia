IMPLODE WARLOCK

The implode spell is cast by warlocks that have mastered the invocation sphere.
It allows the warlock to infuse an object with magical energies, effectivly
overloading it's physical balance, causing it to explode. A warlock should
dispose of the imploded object after enchanting it, since it will damage anyone
in the same room as the object.
