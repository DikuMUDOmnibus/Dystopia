METAL LEECHES
'METAL LEECHES' LEECHES WARLOCK
1
The metal leeches spell is a summoning spell used by Warlocks. It will 
cause a group of leeches to attack the target of the spell, which will
start draining hitpoints from the targets equipment (and slowly but
securely destroying all the targets equipment). Metal leeches will only
last for a short period, so anyone struck by this spell only needs to
keep their equipment intact until the spell fades (repair spells, or
resistant equipment).
