BEACON
BEACON WARLOCK
1
The beacon enchantment is a personal enchantment cast by the warlocks that
have mastered the sphere of enchantments. This enchantment makes the warlock
a conduit for the weave of magic, allowing him or her to cast chain spells
at a reduced cost. The enchantment does have the nasty sideaffect that no
mana will be regenerated while the enchantment is active.
