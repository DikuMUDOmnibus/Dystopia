COUNTERSPELL SPELL MAGIC
1
The counterspell can be used to countering another players spell as it is
being cast. Since spells takes time to cast, you have a chance of casting
this spell on another player and thus ending the spell they are trying to
cast.

It has a low casting time compared to most other spells, so it should be
possible to pull off a counter or two with some quick responses.

Syntax: cast counterspell [victim]
