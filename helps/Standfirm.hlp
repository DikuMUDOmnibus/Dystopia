STANDFIRM
STANDFIRM GIANT
1
The standfirm command allows the giant to plant his or her legs firmly
in the ground, making them more resistant to attacks.

Keeping standfirm enabled will slowly drain giantpoints away from the
giant, so only use this if you have plenty to spare, or need this power
in playerkilling situations.
