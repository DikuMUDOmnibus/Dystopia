This evolve can be gained by any giant who meets the statistics requirements
and have not yet picked the giant evolve '@@heat metal@'. This spell works as
a regeneration booster, which will increase the regenrate of the target
player in a period of a few seconds (4-6). It can be used for free on one
self, and at a small cost in movement points on other players/mobiles.
