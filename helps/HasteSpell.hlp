HASTE SPELL
'HASTE SPELL' HASTESPELL GIANT
1
The haste spell can be cast by giant shamans, and will increase the amount of
attacks a player has each combat round (doesn't affect the chance to hit, only
the amount of attacks). This spell can be dispelled, like any other normal
spell.

To gain this spell, the shaman must pick the 'hast spell' evolve, which opposes
the '@@slow spell@' evolve.

Syntax: hastspell [victim]
