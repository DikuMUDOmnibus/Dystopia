SUPKEEP
SUPKEEP SHADOWLORD
1
This command allows a shadowlord to decide how long his or her combo affects
should stay active outside combat. The default time is roughly 25 seconds.

Remember that shadowlord combo affects drains shadowpoints while active, so
it might not be a good idea to have this setting to high.
