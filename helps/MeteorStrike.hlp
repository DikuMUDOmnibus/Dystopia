METEOR STRIKE
'METEOR STRIKE' 'METEOR SWARM' WARLOCK
1
The two warlock attacks, meteor strike and swarm are simple invocations 
which will strike a single target. The superior (and more costly) attack 
is the meteor swarm, which will strike the target with three meteors, 
where the normal meteor strike will hit with only one. The damage of these 
strikes depends on the damroll of the warlock, as well as the damage dealt 
by the warlocks chosen weapon.
