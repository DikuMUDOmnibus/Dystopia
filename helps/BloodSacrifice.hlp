BLOOD SACRIFICE
'BLOOD SACRIFICE' BLOODSACRIFICE FAE
1
This evolve allows a fae to substitute an instant sacrifice of health for
a period of increased healing. Basicly the fae will sacrifice 2000 hps
to gain 3000 hps over the next 6 seconds (500 hps per second). The command
is lagless but can only be used once every 10 seconds.

This evolve opposes the '@@prismatic wall@' evolve, and a fae can only
gain one of these two evolves.
