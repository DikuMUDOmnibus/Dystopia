HOME
HOME CONFIGURATION
1
A player can create up to 3 recall points, using the HOME command. The player
can later use the @@RECALL@ command to return to these recall points.

Certain places cannot be stored as a recall point, either because the sacredness
of the place prevents it (safe rooms), or because certain magical affects has
been placed in the room which prevents this.

As many as 3 recall points can be stored.
