STATCAP
STATCAP
1
The statcap is the maximum amount of hitpoints, move and mana that can be
trained using the train command. Spells and objects might allow you to go
beyond this statcap. The statcap is set to 40.000 for all classes, and
each time you evolve, this limit is raised by 5.000. So a character that
has evolved three times, should be able to train his or her statistics as
high as 55.000
 
Please note that a player that is not @@PKREADY@ has a statcap of 10.000.
