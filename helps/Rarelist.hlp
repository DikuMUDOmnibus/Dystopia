The command RARELIST can be used to list all the rares in either your
inventory or inside a container. It will list the value of the item
next to it, allowing you to easy see what an item is worth.

If you use the command without any arguments, it will show the items
in your inventory (it will only show @@rare@ and @@sentient@ items).
