UNLEASHED
UNLEASHED FAE
1
The nature power unleashed is powered by the ancients of the fae. The
higher the ancients have been channeled, the more attacks the unleashing
will cause.

Due to the nature of the attack, only mobiles currently attacking the
fae will be struck - the unleashing turns the body of the fae into a
chatotic swirl of ancient energies, all of which will strike those
attacking the fae.
