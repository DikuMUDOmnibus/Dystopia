SPELLGUARD
SPELLGUARD CANTRIP GIANT
1
Giant shamans can learn two new blue spells, if they pick the right evolves.
These two spells are called cantrip and Spellguard.

Spellguard is a protective enchantment, which will block the next offensive
spell cast against the person protected by the spellguard.

Cantrip is a bag of mixed goodies, creating a random, usually good, affect.
