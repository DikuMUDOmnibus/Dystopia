GAROTTE
GAROTTE SHADOWLORD
1
This evolve can be gained by any shadowlord that has already gained the level 1
evolve '@@assassin@'. It opposes the '@@awareness@' evolve, and only one of these
two evolves can be gained.

This evolve adds a special garotte attack to any assassination attempt made by
this shadowlord. The extra attack is automatic.
