MOUNTAIN KING
'MOUNTAIN KING' MKING WARLOCK
1
The mountain king evolve, allows a warlock to turn his or her body into
a substance as solid as a mountain rock. As long as the warlock pays the
upkeep cost for this power, any weapons striking the warlock will be
slightly damaged (and eventually break, unless repaired). The same
command is used to toggle 'king of the mountain' on/off.

This evolve opposes the '@@doombolt@' evolve, and only one of these
evolves can be gained.
