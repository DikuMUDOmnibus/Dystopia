WARRIORS PATH
'WARRIORS PATH' GIANT
1
A giant which picks the warriors path over the shamans path, becomes faster
in combat, thus scoring more hits. A giant can only pick one of these two
paths, and the choice will affect which other evolves the giant can pick.

The effect of this evolve is automatic.
