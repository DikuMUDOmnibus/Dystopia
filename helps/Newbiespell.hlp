NEWBIESPELL SPELL MAGIC
1
The newbiespell allows any character with less than 4 hours played to travel
instantly back to the newbie area (thus being able to pick up a new set of
newbie equipment).

It is highly recommended that new players pick up a full set of newbie
equipment, and cast the resistance spell on it, as well as claiming the
set. This should prevent the equipment from being lost or getting destroyed.
