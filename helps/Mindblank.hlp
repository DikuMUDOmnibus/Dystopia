MINDBLANK
MINDBLANK SHADOWLORD
1
This shadowlord evolve opposes the '@@mindboost@' evolve, and allows the
shadowlord to induce a state of numbness in the mind of others. To gain this
evolve, the shadowlord must first have learned the '@@confusion@' evolve.

When used on another player, this evolve will cause that players commands
to come at a more sluggish rate, slowing their reactions down a bit.

Syntax: mindblank [victim]
