DISJUNCTION
DISJUNCTION WARLOCK
1
This evolve allows a warlock to single out spells of a specific type, and try
to dispel them, without affecting any other spells currently affecting him or
her. It cannot be countered by the '@@counterspell@' spell.

This evolve requires the '@@mountain king@' evolve, and opposes the evolve
known as '@@pulse of the earth@', and only one of these evolves can be gained.
