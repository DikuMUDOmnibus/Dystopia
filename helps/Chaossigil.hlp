CHAOSSIGIL
CHAOSSIGIL FAE
1
The powerful arcanists, within the ranks of the fae, have the power to paint a 
sigil of madness and chaos upon any players forehead, causing great pain upon
the inflicted player. How long this sigil will stay in place is a matter of
pure chaos (ie. no one knows), but should the target ever go below 0 hitpoints,
the sigil will fade away automatically.

Syntax: chaossigil [player]
