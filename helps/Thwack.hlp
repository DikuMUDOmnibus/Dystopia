THWACK
THWACK SMACK BASH GIANT
1
The giants have three attack types which can be used with great effect while
fighting both players and mobiles. The observant giant who uses the right
attack type will land three extra attacks each round (where the less observant
Giant will land just one). Figuring out how these attacks work the best is
part of playing the Giant class.

The three attacks are: smack, thwack and bash.
