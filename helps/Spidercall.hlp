SPIDERCALL
SPIDERCALL FAE
1
The fae power SPIDERCALL can be used to summon a horde of web-spinning 
spiders, which will make it impossible for the faes opponents to flee from 
combat. These spiders will keep spinning their web as long as the spell 
lasts. The person webbed can use the FLEX command to break free, but the 
spiders may grow another web after a short period.
