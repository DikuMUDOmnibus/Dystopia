MATTERSHIELD
MATTERSHIELD FAE
1
The mattershield can be infused by faes who have channeled enough matter with the 
@@channel@ command. The mattershield will has a small chance of striking back at 
whoever attacks the fae, and will slowly deteriorate over time and use. The 
higher the matter has been channeled, the longer the infused mattershield will 
last.
