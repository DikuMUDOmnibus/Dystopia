SUNSET AGE
'SUNSET AGE' WARLOCK
1
This evolve allows a warlock to induce old age in others. The target of
the spell will become weak and other spell affects on the target will
fade as time fades by at a rapid pace.

This evolve is opposed by the '@@time travel@' evolve, and requires the
'@@path of time@' evolve to be gained first.

Syntax: sunset [victim]
