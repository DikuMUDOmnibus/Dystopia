CONFUSION
CONFUSION SHADOWLORD
1
This shadowlord evolve opposes the '@@shadowplane@' evolve, and allows the 
shadowlord to induce a sort of madness in their opponents. Any player or 
mobile struck by confusion is likely to do unrequsted actions, like 
walking away, going berserk or just stand still and do nothing.

The confusion lasts until dispelled or it fades away on it's own.

Syntax: confusion [victim]
