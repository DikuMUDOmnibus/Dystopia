MARTIAL
MARTIAL SHADOWLORD
1
Martial skill is the backbone of the shadowlords fighting prowess. Each
rank costs primal, but will increase the shadowlords ability to dodge
and parry, as well as increase his or her damcap.

The spirits soaring power also depends on the martial skill of the
shadowlord, so there is a double reason for increasing this statistic.
