BINDING VINES
'BINDING VINES' WARLOCK
1
The warlock room enchantment Binding Vines will summon a wild plant
to the room, which vines acts like a magical webbing, that will entrap
anyone in the room (except the caster). These webbings can be broken
with the flex command, but as long as a person is webbed, they cannot
flee from combat or move out of the room.
