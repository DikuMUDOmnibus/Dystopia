GIANTGROWTH
GIANTGROWTH GROWTH
1
A giant can grow 5 times, each time he gains another 5 feet (starting as a
tiny little giant at 5 feet). Each growth level gives access to one more
power or ability.

10 feet : Dawnstrength   (damroll/hitroll booster)
15 feet : @@Sweep@          (powerful attack)
20 feet : Earthswallow   (makes the earth swallow target)
25 feet : Scry           (far-seeing command)
30 feet : Deathfrenzy    (extra damage - only when very hurt)
