SHADOWVEIL
SHADOWVEIL SHADOWLORD
1
The shadowveil is a special type of walls which can be summoned by the most
powerful of shadowlords. These walls will confuse anyone passing through
them, and most likely leave them stranded at the location they where trying
to leave. Shadowlords are immune to this confusing effect.
