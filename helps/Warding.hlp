WARDING
WARDING GLYPHS' FAE
1
Any faerie with this ability can create warding glyphs, and enscribe these
powerful wardings on the floor. When stepped on, these wards will flare
and hurt anyone in the room. The magic of the wards will fade over time,
and the older a glyph is, the less damage it will deal.

The evolve that allows faerie to use this power is based on the '@@arcane@'
evolve and opposes the '@@chameleon skin@' evolve.
