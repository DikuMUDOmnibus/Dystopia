DISCTRAIN
DISCTRAIN FAE
1
This is the Fae discipline training command, which allows a Fae to improve
his or her @@nature@ and @@arcane@ disciplines. Improving disciplines costs
primal, and the more primal you have, the better the chance of getting a
new rank in the given discipline (you need roughly 20 primal per level for
a decent chance).

Syntax: disctrain [nature|arcane]
