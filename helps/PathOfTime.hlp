PATH OF TIME
'PATH OF TIME' WARLOCK
1
The Path of Time evolve opposes the Path of Space evolve, and allows
a warlock to cast normal spells much faster than other players. It will
increase the casting speed of all simple spells by either 50% or a full
combat round, depending on the type of spell.

This evolve works automatically after it has been gained.
