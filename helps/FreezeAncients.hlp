FREEZE ANCIENTS
'FREEZE ANCIENTS' FREEZEANCIENTS FAE
1
This evolve allows a fae to delay his or her next channeling of ancient energy,
thus allowing the fae to keep the channelled energy for a longer period without
suffering from a backlash of energies.

This evolve requires the '@@dragons breath@' evolve, and opposes the evolve known
as '@@halo@', and only one of these two evolves can be gained.
