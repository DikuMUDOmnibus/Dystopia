PULSE OF THE EARTH
'PULSE OF THE EARTH' WARLOCK
1
This evolve allows a focused warlock to increase the regeneration rate of
mystical energies (mana). The warlock cannot have a fight timer, and must
not be fighting, or the regeneration bonus will not take affect.

This evolve requires the '@@mountain king@' evolve, and opposes the evolve
known as '@@disjunction@', and only one of these evolves can be gained.

This power works automatically.
