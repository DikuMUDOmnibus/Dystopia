ABSORBING SHIELD
'ABSORBING SHIELD' FAE
1
This evolve allows a faerie to absorb any hostile spells cast at him or her,
effectively channeling the energy into their body as mana and health. This
evolve is opposed by the '@@deflecting shield@' evolve, and requires that the
fae has chosen the '@@nature@' evolve.

The effect of this evolve is automatic.
