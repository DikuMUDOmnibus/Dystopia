SOULSEEKERS
SOULSEEKERS SOULTARGET SHADOWLORD
1
The shadowlords have access to a spiritual power called soulseekers.
First the shadowlord must target the soul of another being, using the
command soultarget (can only be used against someone the shadowlord
is currently fighting). After locking on to the other persons soul,
the shadowlord can use the soulseek command to damage the other person,
no matter where that person may be hiding. The soulseekers will only
be able to hit for a short period after the lock has been made.
