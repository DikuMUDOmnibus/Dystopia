BATTLETRAIN
BATTLETRAIN GIANT
1
Giants can train both their defensive skills and their attack skills with
the battletrain command. The higher attack skill, the more likely the
giant is to hit what they attack, and the higher the defense skill, the
less likely they are to be hit by those attacking them.

Battletrained skills do not affect damage dealt or received.

Both defense and attack can be trained as far as level 10, and the cost is
2 million per level (so level 6 would cost 12 million).
