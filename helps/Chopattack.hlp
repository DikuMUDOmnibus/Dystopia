CHOPATTACK
CHOPATTACK 'CHOP ATTACK' GIANT
1
The chopattack evolve requires that the giant has first gained the warrior
evolve, and it opposes the '@@deathfrenzy@' evolve.

The command 'chopattack' will initiate a series of combo attacks, which
will end with a special nerve attack that will paralyze the opponents
nerve system. While so affected, the victim will be less likely to dodge
attacks as well as parry them. This affect can be dispelled with the
dispel magic spell.
