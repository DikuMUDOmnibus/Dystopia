MINDBOOST
MINDBOOST SHADOWLORD
1
This shadowlord evolve opposes the '@@mindblank@' evolve, and allows the
shadowlord to induce a state of increased awareness in any player including
themself. To gain this evolve, the shadowlord must first have leared the
'@@confusion@' evolve.

When used on a player, this power will increase the rate that commands
are executed, increasing reaction time by a bit.
