PRECOGNITION
PRECOGNITION WARLOCK
1
Any warlock that has gained the '@@contingency chain@' evolve can also gain
this evolve, which allows the warlock to mindmeld with a monster, giving the
warlock an edge in combat, helping them dodge and parry attacks that would
normally have been impossible.

This evolve opposes the '@@seven stitches@' evolve, and only one of these two
evolves can be gained.

Syntax: precognition [victim]
