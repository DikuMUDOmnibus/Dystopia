BLOODRAGE
BLOODRAGE SHADOWLORD
1
The bloodrage combo is a special shadowlord attack, which turns the shadow into
a battlemad raging killer - this will last as long as the combat or until the 
shadow tries another combo attack (which requires more concentration than can be 
allowed during the bloodrage). When in the bloodrage, the shadowlord will gain 
extra attacks and be more likely to hit their opponent.
