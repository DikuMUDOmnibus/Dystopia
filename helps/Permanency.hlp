PERMANENCY
PERMANENCY SPELL MAGIC
1
The permanency spell can be used to make a spell affect almost permanent. The
spell has a small chance of failure, which can result in a drastic decrease in
the spells duration. Trying to cast this spell will cost the caster 5 points of
primal energy. In case of a succesfully casted permanency, the targetted affect
will have it's duration increased by as much as 25 hours.
