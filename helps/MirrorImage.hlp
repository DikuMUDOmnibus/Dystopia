'MIRROR IMAGE' MIRRORIMAGE SHADOWLORD
1
This evolve can be gained by any shadowlord that has first gained the evolve
known as '@@concussion fumes@'. It opposes the evolve '@@frostblast@' and only
one of these two evolves can be gained.

This evolve allows the shadowlord to create the illusion (through mind
altering fumes) that the person fighting the shadowlord is actually fighting
him or herself. The shadowlord will continue fighting the victim of the fumes.
