Dystopia 1.4CE-2 comes with support for the Mud eXtension
Protocol (MXP). Everything is handled by the wrapper function
mxp_to_char(), which works much like send_to_char(), with
one exception. It takes an additional argument, the style
of MXP tags being send.

The different styles are
========================
MXP_SAFE  : This style should be used for strings that players
            can affect, like chatting, showing equipment, etc.
            Only safe tags, like changing the font to bold,
            underlining, etc works in this mode.
MXP_ALL   : All tags works in this mode, and it should only
            be used by the server when it sends strings that
            cannot be affected by the players (like showing
            exits or help files).
MXP_NONE  : This style is redundant, since the server could
            just use the normal send_to_char() instead. In
            this mode, no MXP tags will work.

The server handles player-support of MXP transparent - when a
player connects to the mud, the server ask their client if
it supports MXP, and will parse the MXP messages when needed.
If the client doesn't support MXP, the server will simply
strip the MXP tags before sending the data, so you don't have
to worry about sending MXP tags to players that don't support
reading the MXP tags.

I have added one example of MXP stuff to the code, you can
add more as you please. If you look in jobo_util() and find
get_exits(), it will show the code for hyperlinking exits,
meaning players can use their mouse to move around, by clicking
on the exits instead of typing north, south, etc.

Currently only zmud 6+ and mushclient supports MXP, but more
clients will likely support this nice feature in the future.
