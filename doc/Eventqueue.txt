Since Dystopia 1.4CE2 the codebase uses an eventqueue to update
most of the game, which replaces the old DIKU style mob autonomy
update loops.

In the file event.c you will find a series of event functions,
which has the following prototype

bool event_[game/mobile/object/room]_[somename] ( EVENT_DATA *event );

For instance, there is an event function that looks like this

bool event_object_decay ( EVENT_DATA *event )

Common for all such event functions is the following
====================================================

1) They will return TRUE if they handle the dequeue'ing
   of the event themselfs (either by calling dequeue_event(),
   or because the owner of the event was extracted/destroyed).
   In any other case, they will return FALSE.

2) They all take an EVENT_DATA structure as an argument. This
   structure contains all the information needed to handle
   the event.


You will also find several support functions, like an enqueuing,
a dequeueing function, some initializing functions and much more.
The important ones to notice are the initializers, since they
are called on mobiles, objects, rooms, etc whenever such are
created or logs into the game. For instance, all players have
an autosave event, which triggers every 2nd minute.

If you wish to use the event queue, you should try to understand
how the code works, for this purpose a snippet/howto can be found
at the following location

The code no longer uses tick timers of any kind (well, almost none),
so you'll have to rethink how you normally have stuff automaticly
fade. Also, objects are set to decay using object_decay(), since
there no longer is an update function for items.

Have fun
