The mud has an integrated webserver which runs on the port just above the
muds own port (if you are not allowed to run on more than one port, simply
disable the webserver - it's started, polled and stopped in comm.c).

The webserver can handle finger, who, notes and helpfiles, and players
can visit it with a browser like this (we assume that your mud runs on
the addy mud.homeomorph.org port 9009)

http://mud.homeomorph.org:9010/

Simple as that, use the same addy for the website, and add the portnumber
plus 1 after the colon. Look in the file webif.c for adding more stuff
if you want, it should be rather straighforward.

You can find some example PHP scripts in the html folder.
