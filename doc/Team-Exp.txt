There is a new group/team experience system, which is more fair, and
solved some problems in the old system. Back in the old days, players
where able to boost their own characters, or characters belonging to
friends, by giving them a super experience ride, in areas where that
new character wouldn't normally be able to exp.

Also, why shouldn't the large player that does most of the work get
the most experience for the kill ?

The following example shows how a team of 4 players gets rewarded for
killing a large monster. The powerlevel refered to in the example,
is the same powerlevel which is used to calculate the pk-range of
players, and many other things.

The following party teams up and kills the King of Atlantis, earning
the team a whopping 1.423.423 experience base to divide between them.

Group      Powerlevel   %PL/Group  %XP/Kill   Mods        Team-Exp / Alone-Exp
===============================================================================
Player A :   1980        (54%)      ( 81%)     85%       2.132.999 / 2.633.332
Player B :    722        (19%)      ( 28%)     50%         597.837 / 2.135.134
Player C :    892        (24%)      ( 36%)     45%         743.026 / 2.063.963
Player D :    150        ( 4%)      (  6%)    100%         170.081 / 2.846.846
===============================================================================
Total        3644        (97%)      (151%)               3.643.943

So, due to teaming up, and various experience bonusses, the team earned
much more experience (total between them), than any one of them could
have earned by killing the mob by themself. Most likely, the newbie and
the two medium players wouldn't have been able to take out the king alone,
and Player A didn't loose all that much experience by teaming up with
his friends.

The formula goes something like this.

1) Each player calculates his or her powerlevel, and get's a bite of
   the exp-cake corresponding to that number compared to the groups
   total powerlevel. So big players in a group would get more exp than
   the small players (only fair).

2) We don't want the experience to be divided equally, but rather give
   a small bonus for teaming up. Thus we add another half of exp to the
   experience gained. So a player that would normally gain 24% of the
   total kill, would instead gain 36% (24 + 24/2). This way, a team
   would end up earning more than the 100% of the total kill, but some
   of the experience is supposed to come from teamwork (if you need
   an excuse for giving out exp).

3) The players own modifiers are added later, when the experience is
   gained by the player. The other teammembers shouldn't be rewarded
   because one of the players had some special bonus.
