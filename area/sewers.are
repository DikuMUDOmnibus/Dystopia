As you move closer to the markings, they increase in brightness. You reach out and touch them with your hand, and suddenly a piece of the wall slides open and a key falls out. You quickly reach down and grab the key.~

A Rusty Ladder~
The ladder hugs the wall tightly, as if any slight movement could cause
it's rusted metal to break. The opening below is not very big and looks like
it could only fit one person going through it at a time.

An Ancient Manhole~
This manhole seems very ancient. A small, rusted ladder leads down to
whatever lies below. It is very humid and dark here, as all the lights that
were placed here have been burnt out.
