The preparation room~
Some use this room to prepare for battle, however only a fool
enters the Forbidden Fortress unprepared. Besides an old 
rusted weapons wrack and a chair, this place is empty.

Hall of shame~
Dead bodies line the hallway and blood stains almost every
inch of the floor. Those who lost their battle remain here 
as a reminder of how grusome death really is.

There is nothing here but bones and bodies. Besides a small 
stairway heading up to the tower the only other way to go is
west.

Tower base~
Some stairs lead upwards to a small tower. A large red banner
hangs by them tattered and bloody from the years of seeing
combat and death. You feel some heat coming from the west.

A dead end~
The only way you can go is back the way you came. The doorway
out has been blocked for many, many years. There are only two
ways out of the forbidden fortress, kill or be killed.

Forbiddden furnace~
A large black furnace pumps out heat to the entire Fortress.
This room is exceptionally hot, and a bright red fire burns
constantly. Even here death shows its mark as the smell of
burnt flesh overwhelms your senses.
